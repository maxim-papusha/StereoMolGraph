StereoMolGraph (SMG) is a lightweight Python library for representing molecules and transition states with explicit, local stereochemistry. It provides:

- Graph types for molecules and reactions (with/without stereo and stereo changes)
- Includes non tetrahedral stereocenters and changing stereochemistry in reactions
- Fast approximate hashing via Weisfeilerâ€“Lehman color refinement
- Robust equality/isomorphism via a VF2++-style algorithm extended for stereochemistry and reactions
- Bidirectional conversion from / to RDKit
- Construction from 3D coordinates with automatic local stereo inference


## Design philosophy

- Unopinionated about bond orders, charge and electronic state
- SMG focuses on the connectivity and stereochemistry. 
- Stereochemistry describes relative spatial arrangement. No absolute stereochemistry.
- Transparent: Simple 2D visualization in IPython notebooks


## Examples

Explore the working example notebooks in `docs/examples/` (executed in CI). For rendered examples and guides, see the documentation: https://stereomolgraph.readthedocs.io

## RDKit interoperability notes

- Hydrogens must be explicit for stereo-safe bidirectional conversion.
- Supports tetrahedral and non tetrahedral stereochemistry during conversion.
- Bond orders, charges, unpaired electrons and other properties are not used!

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install stereomolgraph
```
